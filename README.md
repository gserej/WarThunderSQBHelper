# War Thunder SQB Helper

An Android application created to help tracking numbers of remainig ally and enemy units in War Thunder Squadron Battles.

## Prerequisites:
1. Check [the local IP adress of the PC](https://kb.wisc.edu/27309) you are running War Thunder on.
2. While connected to a local WiFi network with your phone/tablet, check if you can access this IP via a browser. If not, application won't work.
3. In the application settings menu type in your squadron tag and that IP adress.

- Press the "Reset" button every time you start a battle to reset numbers.
